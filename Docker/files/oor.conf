# IPv4 / IPv6 EID of the node.

#   iid: Instance ID associated to the EID. When using VXLAN-GPE, iid configures
#     the VNI of the mapping. [0-16777215]
# Two types of RLOCs can be defined:
#   rloc-address: Specifies directly the RLOC of the interface
#     address: It could be one of the following cases
#       - IPv4 or IPv6 address of the RLOC. Address should exist and
#        be assigned to an UP interface during startup process otherwise
#        it is discarded.
#       - ELP name
#   rloc-iface: Specifies the interface associated with the RLOC
#     interface: interface containing the RLOCs associated to this mapping 
#     ip_version: 4 to use the IPv4 address of the interface and 6 to use the IPv6 
#       address of the interface
# Both types of RLOCs use priority and weight
#   priority [0-255]: Priority for the RLOC of the interface. Locators
#     with lower values are more preferable. This is used for both incoming
#     policy announcements and outgoing traffic policy management.
#   weight [0-255]: When priorities are the same for multiple RLOCs, the weight
#     indicates how to balance unicast traffic between them.
